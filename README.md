# FRC-Toolchain-On-Fedora

These are spec files that are to be used for building the C++ toolchain the 2018 Power Up FIRST Robotics Competition.

The goal here is, to some degree, give a Fedora/RPM alternative to the Ubuntu PPA and Arch Linux builds found here:

# COPR

The build packages are available here:
