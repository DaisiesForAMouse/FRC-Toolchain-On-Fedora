# FRC-Toolchain-On-Fedora

These are spec files that are to be used for building the C++ toolchain the 2018 Power Up FIRST Robotics Competition.

The goal here is , to some degree, give a Fedora/RPM alternative to the Ubnutu PPA and Arch Linux builds found here:
http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/toolchains/

Note: Not the highest quality of RPM spec files here, so some will find it preferable to build from source, but it will pass to build on most typical systems.
